  ## From Bare Metal to Abstraction
  A There and Back Again Tale to the Heart of Cloud-Native Computing.

  Over the past 30 years we've seen a quick evolution from bare metal servers and infrastructure to a reliance on Cloud Native practices, principles, and services. But have you ever stopped to think about what it was like before you could just typeÂ aws ec2 run-instances --instance-type m2.xlargeÂ orÂ gcloud compute instances createÂ to spin up a new server or service? And how things actually got done when you had to wait 6 months for a server?
  In this talk, Jeremy will walk through infrastructure's evolution from his time in the mid-90s as a SysAdmin at an Internet Provider and shadow IT in the 2000s, to the growth of ,today's cloud native world. He'll highlight the enduring importance of core operational principles and explore how lessons from the "dark ages" of IT, particularly regarding automation and standardization, remain vital in today's cloud-native world. You'll gain a crucial historical context of infrastructure evolution, transforming their understanding from "how" to use the cloud to "why" it works the way it does, hopefully making them better engineers, and also have a chuckle or two.

# From Bare Metal to Abstraction
## A There and Back Again Tale to the Heart of Cloud-Native Computing.

<!--
I did entertain the idea of coming out dressed as Gandalf or Bilbo Baggins, but thankfully only for a moment. And don't let my gray beard fool you - this is not going to entirely be a talk about the days of yesteryear. I promise to keep it relevant to today and the future. Plus I only have 20 minutes, so I can't go too far down the rabbit hole. But I do want to take you on a journey through time and space, from the dark ages of IT to the bright future of cloud-native computing. So buckle up, because we're about to embark on an adventure that will make even Bilbo Baggins proud.

I eventually moved into the Network Operations Center, and became a SysAdmin and Network Admin and was installing ISDN around KC, using the original IOS (Cisco Internetwork OS) to program Cisco 2500s and 7000s. I even had a Cisco 7000 under my desk and a dedicated T1 - with 1.544 Mbps (megabits per second) transfer rates. Those were the days... Like all of us back then, we were learning on the job! I mean who didn't accidentally mess up internet routes and bring down portions of the internet with routing leaks and route flapping?

Who all knows that BGP (border gateway protocol) was invented in 1989 here in Austin at an IETF meeting, on the back of some napkins? It was commonly referred to as the "two napkin protocol" because of that.

In the early 2000s I was at Sprint where I survived 11 years, and ended up being shadow IT for the Network Services department. I started automating and migrating intricate Excel spreadsheets and Access databases to ASP web applications with MySQL and had a whole server farm under my desk. By which I mean 3 Dell OptiPlex desktops fully upgraded running VMWare and VirtualBox. Couldn't find a good image, and only Claude could create one that came close to depicting my cubicle.

Back then there was no such thing as "cloud computing" - it was all about bare metal servers and virtualization. [click]I mean, who remembers the days of having to physically rack and stack servers in a data center? Or the thrill of getting a new server and having to install everything from scratch? It was like Christmas morning, but with more sweat and tears. [click]And blood. Who else still has the scars from sharp server racks and the internals of servers, where evidently the engineers were not concerned about safety and didn't think to dull the steel edges? [click]The amount of DNA that can be found in servers will keep future archaeologists busy for years trying to figure out when we created cyborgs.

<!--
The process to get a server was a long and arduous one. You had to go to Dell's website, customize what you wanted, and then send it over to IT fulfillment, wait for your manager to approve, then wait for the hardware to be ordered, and then shipped - a process that took a few months. [click]Meanwhile you had to submit an IT ticket to let them know a server was being shipped to a specific data center and that you needed space, and then they would eventually assign a rack, [click]and then you would have to submit a different ticket to a different team to schedule a time for you to come into the data center to set it up. [click]And if you were lucky, you might get a server within a month or two. But if you were really unlucky, you might have to wait six months or more. And that was before you had to install and configure everything.

And that was just building servers in the late 90s and early 2000s. Think about all of the other things we had to do back then. We had to manually configure just about everything, from the network settings to the operating system. And if something went wrong, well, good luck trying to figure out what it was because online docs and support systems weren't available. We didn't have the luxury of cloud providers and their fancy dashboards and APIs. There was no ClickOps. We had to rely on our own wits and a lot of trial and error.

## The Dark Ages of IT

- No online documentation
- Power switch kicked off meant a 30-minute drive to the data center
- Data recovery bandwidth as fast as a car loaded with tapes could drive
- Didn't update things until something was broke
- Large binders of CDs for every OS and program in the company
- Hotswap was a myth (and no one really used SCSI back then ðŸ¤£ )
- Sneakernet filesharing

[/r/sysadmin](https://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/1f6wvlq/what_was_it_like_to_be_a_sysadmin_in_the_90s_or/) horror stories are fun, if not a bit triggering <br /><br />

The best example of "sneakernet" - the practice of physically transporting data on removable media, like floppy disks or CDs, from one computer to another - was this scene from Office Space. Of course it was the hand delivery of a virus, but it's still valid.

<!--
To say that the landscape of Information Technology infrastructure has profoundly changed over the past three decades would be putting it lightly. What began in the mid-1990s as a tangible world of physical servers requiring manual racking, configuration, and constant hands-on maintenance has evolved into a very abstracted, automated, service-oriented landscape known as Cloud Native. This evolution represents not merely an incremental improvement but a fundamental shift in how applications are built, deployed, and managed.

<!--
We no longer have to worry about physical servers and data centers. We can spin up new instances in seconds, and we can scale our applications to meet demand without breaking a sweat. Well, for some of us. There's still someone doing that now, but instead of 1 server per app, it's thousands of apps per server. But with this transformation comes a new set of challenges - that are the same as the old challenges in a different way.

We have to think about things like security, compliance, and cost management in ways that we never had to before. And we have to do it all while keeping up with the rapid pace of change in the industry.

1. Limitations inherent in managing physical servers ==> adoption of virtualization to improve resource utilization
2.


<!--
This journey from bare metal to cloud native, where we've abstracted a lot of these things away, all was for a reason, and has had many different stages. It started with the limitations of bare metal servers, which led to the rise of virtualization and the ability to run multiple operating systems on a single physical server. This was followed by the introduction of cloud computing, which allowed us to rent compute resources on demand, rather than having to buy and maintain our own hardware. The rise of DevOps and the cultural shift towards collaboration and automation further accelerated this transformation, breaking down silos between development and operations teams.

The journey from the constraints of bare-metal hardware to the flexibility of the cloud involved several critical stages. It began with the limitations inherent in managing physical servers, leading to the adoption of virtualization to improve resource utilization. This paved the way for Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) and Platform as a Service (PaaS), which offered compute resources and development platforms on demand. Concurrently, the DevOps movement fostered a cultural shift towards collaboration and automation, breaking down traditional silos. Containerization, popularized by Docker, provided a standardized way to package applications , while orchestration platforms like Kubernetes emerged to manage these containers at scale. These technological and cultural shifts culminated in the Cloud Native approach, characterized by microservices, continuous delivery, and automated management. involves a has not been without its challenges. We've had to learn new tools, new languages, and new ways of thinking about infrastructure. We've had to adapt to a world where everything is constantly changing, and where the only constant is change itself.
